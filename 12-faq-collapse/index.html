                What is Pokemon Unite? What do I need to know about it?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                Pokemon Unite is a multiplayer pokemon battle where you win by scoring more points than the other team before time runs out. Score points by capturing wild pokemon and dunking those points into goals in enemy territory. It is similar to League of Legends, except faster and less complex.

                How long do games of Pokemon Unite take?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                Each standard game of Pokemon Unite is 10 minutes long. Unlike other MOBA games, matches in Unite are designed to be short and to the point, and the game design encourages last-minute comebacks if you really focus. There's also quick match games that take only 5 minutes.

                Can I rank up in Pokemon Unite?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                Yes. Trainer level is tied to rewards for playing continuously. Rewards include items for your pokemon, pokemon licenses, and apparel for your trainer. Certain maps and game modes are gated behind trainer levels as well.
